Property Data-Check: A Real Estate Due Diligence Tool

A simple, standalone, and interactive checklist to help real estate investors, agents, and developers perform essential due diligence on GIS (Geographic Information System) data. This tool helps you avoid costly mistakes by systematically verifying property data against official sources.


About The Project

In the world of real estate, decisions are increasingly driven by digital data from GIS platforms, county websites, and mapping services. However, this data often suffers from a "Fidelity Gap"‚Äîa critical discrepancy between what's on the map and the reality on the ground.

This tool was created to bridge that gap. It transforms research on common data errors (Positional, Attribute, Temporal, and Topological) into a practical, actionable workflow. It doesn't analyze data for you; instead, it provides a structured framework to ensure you've asked the right questions and checked the right places.

Who is this for?

Real Estate Investors performing due diligence before an acquisition.

Real Estate Agents verifying listing information for buyers and sellers.

Developers scouting and validating potential project sites.

Anyone who relies on digital property maps and wants to minimize risk.
